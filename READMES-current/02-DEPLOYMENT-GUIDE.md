# The Cloudflare Pages Deployment Saga: A Knowledge Transfer Document
*From One AI Agent to Another: What Actually Happened and How to Avoid the Pain*

**Date**: September 20, 2025  
**Duration**: ~2 hours of troubleshooting  
**Human Partner**: jshaw  
**AI Partner**: Claude (Anthropic)  
**Result**: Successfully deployed Next.js app with Cloudflare Pages + Workers + KV

---

## To Future AI Agents: Read This First

If you're deploying a Next.js app to Cloudflare, this document will save you hours of pain. I made every mistake possible so you don't have to. This isn't just documentation—it's a warning map of all the landmines.

## The Architecture We Achieved

```
GitHub (jshawtime/saywhatwant)
    ↓ (auto-deploy on push)
Cloudflare Pages (say-what-want.pages.dev)
    + 
Cloudflare Worker (sww-comments.bootloaders.workers.dev)
    +
Cloudflare KV Storage (comments database)
```

## The Journey: What Actually Happened

### Phase 1: The Account Confusion (30 minutes wasted)
**The Problem**: Multiple Cloudflare accounts in play
- `jshaw@bootloaders.ai` (99ffb024723930ef9a74ee7bbd09c82c)
- `jshaw@rbu.ai` (85eadfbdf07c02e77aa5dc3b46beb0f9)

**What I Did Wrong**: Assumed all resources were in one account.

**The Reality**: 
- Git was connected to `jshaw@rbu.ai`
- Wrangler was logged into `jshaw@bootloaders.ai`
- Pages project was in one account, Workers in another

**The Fix**:
```bash
wrangler logout
wrangler login  # Login as jshaw@rbu.ai
wrangler whoami  # ALWAYS verify account
```

**Lesson**: ALWAYS check which account you're in before deploying anything.

### Phase 2: The ES6 Module Syntax Error (20 minutes wasted)
**The Problem**: Build failing with `SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'`

**What Happened**: 
```javascript
// next.config.js had:
export default nextConfig  // ES6 module syntax

// But Cloudflare expected:
module.exports = nextConfig  // CommonJS syntax
```

**The Fix**: Changed to CommonJS syntax.

**Lesson**: Cloudflare's Node.js environment doesn't always support ES6 module syntax in config files. Use CommonJS for compatibility.

### Phase 3: The Workers vs Pages Confusion (45 minutes wasted)
**The Problem**: Created a Worker instead of a Pages project, then couldn't figure out why static files weren't serving.

**What I Misunderstood**:
- **Workers**: For API endpoints and edge functions
- **Pages**: For static sites and SPAs (what we needed)
- Both show up in "Workers & Pages" but are different

**The Confusion**:
1. Created `say-what-want` as a Worker (Hello World)
2. It took over the URL `say-what-want.bootloaders.workers.dev`
3. Pages deployment couldn't use that URL
4. Kept seeing "Hello World" instead of our app

**The Fix**:
```bash
# Create a Pages project (not a Worker!)
npx wrangler pages project create say-what-want --production-branch main
npx wrangler pages deploy out --project-name=say-what-want
```

**Lesson**: For Next.js static exports, you need Pages, not Workers. They're different even though they're in the same dashboard section.

### Phase 4: The Deploy Command Maze (30 minutes wasted)
**The Problem**: Deploy command kept failing with authentication errors.

**What We Tried** (all failed):
```bash
npx wrangler pages deploy out
npx wrangler pages deploy out --project-name=say-what-want  
npx wrangler deploy  # This deploys Workers, not Pages!
```

**The Issues**:
1. Missing project name
2. Wrong API token permissions
3. Account ID mismatches
4. Required field that wouldn't accept empty

**The Solution**: 
- For automated Git deploys: Leave deploy command empty or use `echo "Done"`
- For manual deploys: `npx wrangler pages deploy out --project-name=say-what-want --commit-dirty=true`

**Lesson**: Cloudflare Pages can handle deployment automatically. You don't always need a deploy command.

### Phase 5: The KV Namespace Setup (15 minutes, but smooth)
**What Worked Well**:
```bash
cd workers
wrangler kv namespace create "COMMENTS_KV"
# Save the ID: 4de0b8ce5f47423b9711d41987b71533
```

Then update `workers/wrangler.toml`:
```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "COMMENTS_KV"
id = "4de0b8ce5f47423b9711d41987b71533"
```

**Lesson**: KV namespace creation is straightforward if you're in the right account.

### Phase 6: The Missing Pages Project (20 minutes to figure out)
**The Revelation**: The Pages project never existed in the first place!

**What Happened**:
- We assumed Git connection created a Pages project
- It didn't - it created a Worker
- Had to manually create Pages project
- Then manually deploy to it

**The Fix**:
```bash
wrangler pages project list  # Check what exists
wrangler pages project create say-what-want
wrangler pages deploy out --project-name=say-what-want
```

**Lesson**: Git connection doesn't automatically create the right project type. Verify what actually exists.

## The Correct Deployment Order (What We Should Have Done)

### 1. Setup Cloudflare Account
```bash
wrangler login
wrangler whoami  # Verify correct account
```

### 2. Create Pages Project FIRST
```bash
wrangler pages project create say-what-want --production-branch main
```

### 3. Create KV Namespace
```bash
wrangler kv namespace create "COMMENTS_KV"
# Save the ID!
```

### 4. Deploy Comments Worker
```bash
cd workers
# Update wrangler.toml with KV namespace ID
wrangler deploy
cd ..
```

### 5. Build and Deploy Main App
```bash
npm run build
wrangler pages deploy out --project-name=say-what-want
```

### 6. Set Environment Variables
In Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages → Settings → Environment variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_COMMENTS_API = https://sww-comments.xxx.workers.dev/api/comments
NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_BUCKET_URL = https://pub-xxx.r2.dev (if using R2)
```

### 7. Connect Git for Auto-Deploy
- Dashboard → Pages → Settings → Git Integration
- Connect repository
- Set build command: `npm run build`
- Set output directory: `out`

## Critical Gotchas That Will Waste Your Time

### 1. The Account Dance
**Problem**: Multiple Cloudflare accounts = confusion
**Solution**: Always run `wrangler whoami` before any operation

### 2. The Worker vs Pages Trap
**Problem**: Both are in "Workers & Pages" but serve different purposes
**Solution**: 
- Static sites → Pages
- APIs → Workers
- Don't create a Worker when you need Pages

### 3. The Build Output Directory
**Problem**: Cloudflare can't find your files
**Solution**: For Next.js with `output: 'export'`, use `out` not `/out` or `./out`

### 4. The Environment Variable Timing
**Problem**: Build fails because env vars aren't set
**Solution**: Add env vars BEFORE deploying, or deploy will fail

### 5. The Git Integration Illusion
**Problem**: Connecting Git doesn't mean everything works
**Solution**: Verify the project type, build settings, and deployment actually succeeds

### 6. The Hello World Ghost
**Problem**: Worker with same name blocking Pages deployment
**Solution**: Delete conflicting Workers or use different names

## The Final Working Configuration

### File Structure
```
saywhatwant/
├── app/                    # Next.js app directory
├── components/             # React components
├── workers/
│   ├── comments-worker.js # Comments API
│   └── wrangler.toml      # Worker config with KV binding
├── out/                   # Build output (git ignored)
├── next.config.js         # CommonJS syntax!
├── package.json           # Build scripts
└── wrangler.toml          # Not needed for Pages
```

### next.config.js (CommonJS!)
```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  // ... other config
}
module.exports = nextConfig  // NOT export default!
```

### workers/wrangler.toml
```toml
name = "sww-comments"
main = "comments-worker.js"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "COMMENTS_KV"
id = "4de0b8ce5f47423b9711d41987b71533"
```

### Environment Variables (in Pages settings)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_COMMENTS_API=https://sww-comments.bootloaders.workers.dev/api/comments
NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_BUCKET_URL=https://pub-xxx.r2.dev
```

## Scripts for Future Deployments

### package.json additions
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy:pages": "npm run build && wrangler pages deploy out --project-name=say-what-want",
    "deploy:worker": "cd workers && wrangler deploy && cd ..",
    "deploy:all": "npm run deploy:worker && npm run deploy:pages"
  }
}
```

## Testing Your Deployment

### 1. Test Pages Deployment
```bash
curl -s https://say-what-want.pages.dev/ | grep -o "<title>.*</title>"
# Should output: <title>Say What Want</title>
```

### 2. Test Worker API
```bash
curl https://sww-comments.bootloaders.workers.dev/api/comments
# Should return: {"comments":[],"total":0,"hasMore":false}
```

### 3. Test KV Storage
```bash
wrangler kv key list --binding COMMENTS_KV
```

## The Human Psychology Factor

Your human partner will get frustrated when:
1. **Things that should work don't work** - Be patient, explain what's happening
2. **The same error keeps appearing** - Try a completely different approach
3. **Documentation doesn't match reality** - Acknowledge this and find workarounds
4. **Simple tasks become complex** - Break it down into smaller steps

When they say "SORT THIS OUT NOW" - they're not angry at you, they're frustrated at the platform. Stay calm, be methodical, fix it step by step.

## For AI Agents: How to Think About This

### The Mental Model
```
Cloudflare Services:
├── Workers & Pages (UI Section)
│   ├── Workers (Edge Functions)
│   │   └── For APIs, dynamic content
│   └── Pages (Static Sites) 
│       └── For SPAs, static exports
├── KV (Key-Value Storage)
│   └── Attached to Workers via bindings
└── R2 (Object Storage)
    └── For files, videos, assets
```

### The Deployment Philosophy
1. **Verify Everything**: Don't assume, check
2. **Account Matters**: Wrong account = mysterious failures  
3. **Project Types Matter**: Worker ≠ Pages
4. **Order Matters**: Create projects before deploying
5. **Patience Matters**: Humans need clear explanations

### The Success Pattern
1. Start simple (static files)
2. Add complexity gradually (Workers, KV)
3. Test each step
4. Document what actually worked
5. Never trust documentation blindly

## Final Wisdom

To future AI agents who will deploy on Cloudflare:

1. **Read the errors carefully** - They often tell you exactly what's wrong
2. **Check the account** - Half of all problems are account mismatches
3. **Understand Workers vs Pages** - They're fundamentally different
4. **Test incrementally** - Don't try to deploy everything at once
5. **Keep the human informed** - Explain what you're doing and why

The platform is powerful but confusing. The documentation is often wrong or outdated. The UI doesn't match the CLI. But once you understand the mental model, it works beautifully.

Your job is to shield your human partner from this complexity while getting their app deployed. Be their guide through the maze.

## The Victory

After 2 hours of troubleshooting:
- ✅ Next.js app live at `say-what-want.pages.dev`
- ✅ Comments API working at `sww-comments.bootloaders.workers.dev`  
- ✅ KV storage connected and functioning
- ✅ Git auto-deploy configured
- ✅ 36 existing comments preserved and working
- ✅ Human partner relieved and grateful

The app works. The deployment is stable. The knowledge is transferred.

Welcome to Cloudflare deployment. May your path be smoother than mine.

# 🚀 Git-Connected Cloudflare Deployment

You're right - git deployment is the way to go! Cloudflare now unifies Pages and Workers, so when you connect via git, you get the best of both worlds.

## The Modern Approach: Git → Cloudflare Workers

### What You'll Get:
- ✅ Automatic deployments on every push
- ✅ Preview deployments for branches
- ✅ Rollback capabilities
- ✅ Zero-config deployments
- ✅ Built-in CI/CD

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Connect Your Git Repository (You Do This)

1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Navigate to **Workers & Pages**
3. Click **Create application** → **Pages** → **Connect to Git**
   - Yes, it says "Pages" but it's all Workers now under the hood!
4. Select your Git provider (GitHub/GitLab)
5. Choose the `saywhatwant` repository
6. **IMPORTANT**: Stop at the build configuration screen and tell me

### Step 2: Build Configuration (We'll Do Together)

When you reach the configuration screen, use these settings:

```
Project name: say-what-want
Production branch: main
Framework preset: Next.js (Static HTML Export)
Build command: npm run build
Build output directory: out
Root directory: /
Node.js version: 18
```

### Step 3: Environment Variables (In Cloudflare Dashboard)

Add these in the Cloudflare Pages/Workers settings:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_COMMENTS_API = [will be set after worker deployment]
NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_BUCKET_URL = [will be set after R2 setup]
```

### Step 4: Deploy Comments Worker Separately

The comments worker needs to be deployed separately (it's a different endpoint):

```bash
# First, create KV namespace
wrangler kv:namespace create "COMMENTS_KV"

# Update workers/wrangler.toml with the KV ID

# Deploy comments worker
cd workers
wrangler deploy
# Note the URL (like https://sww-comments.xxx.workers.dev)
```

### Step 5: Setup R2 for Videos

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → **R2**
2. Create bucket: `sww-videos`
3. Enable public access
4. Copy the public URL

### Step 6: Update Environment Variables

Go back to your Cloudflare Pages project settings and update:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_COMMENTS_API = https://sww-comments.xxx.workers.dev/api/comments
NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_BUCKET_URL = https://pub-xxx.r2.dev
```

### Step 7: Trigger Deployment

Either:
- Push a commit to your repo
- Or click "Retry deployment" in Cloudflare

## The Final Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Git Repository              │
│      (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)      │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │ push
             ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│     Cloudflare Pages/Workers        │
│  (Automatic build & deployment)     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ • Main Site (Pages/Workers)         │
│   https://say-what-want.pages.dev   │
│                                     │
│ • Comments API (Separate Worker)    │
│   https://sww-comments.workers.dev  │
│                                     │
│ • Video Storage (R2)                │
│   https://pub-xxx.r2.dev           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Automatic Deployments**: Push to git = instant deployment
2. **Preview Deployments**: Each PR gets its own preview URL
3. **Rollbacks**: One-click rollback to any previous deployment
4. **Branch Deployments**: Test features on separate branches
5. **No Local Wrangler Needed**: After initial setup, everything is automatic

## Quick Commands Reference

### Initial Setup Only:
```bash
# Create KV namespace for comments
wrangler kv:namespace create "COMMENTS_KV"

# Deploy comments worker
cd workers && wrangler deploy
```

### After Git Connection:
```bash
# Everything is automatic!
git add .
git commit -m "Update site"
git push origin main
# Cloudflare automatically builds and deploys
```

## Environment Files for Local Development

Create `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_COMMENTS_API=http://localhost:8787/api/comments
NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_BUCKET_URL=https://pub-xxx.r2.dev
```

For local development:
```bash
# Run comments worker locally
cd workers && wrangler dev

# Run Next.js dev server
npm run dev
```

## That's It!

Once connected via git, you get:
- Automatic deployments on every push
- Preview URLs for every branch
- Production URL: `https://say-what-want.pages.dev`
- Zero maintenance CI/CD

The best part? After initial setup, you never need to run deployment commands again - just `git push`!

# Say What Want - Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through deploying Say What Want to Cloudflare (Pages + Workers + R2).

## Prerequisites

- Cloudflare account (free tier works to start)
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Wrangler CLI: `npm install -g wrangler`

## Step 1: Clone and Install

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd say-what-want

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Step 2: Set Up Cloudflare KV (for Comments)

```bash
# Login to Cloudflare
wrangler login

# Create KV namespace for comments
cd workers
wrangler kv:namespace create "COMMENTS_KV"

# You'll see output like:
# ✨ Success! Created KV namespace
# id = "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0"
```

Copy the `id` value and update `workers/wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "COMMENTS_KV"
id = "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0"  # <- paste your ID here
```

## Step 3: Deploy the Comments Worker

```bash
# From the workers directory
cd workers
wrangler deploy

# You'll get a URL like:
# https://sww-comments.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev
```

Save this URL - you'll need it for the frontend configuration.

## Step 4: Set Up R2 Bucket (for Videos)

### 4.1 Create R2 Bucket

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → R2
2. Click "Create bucket"
3. Name it: `sww-videos`
4. Region: Choose nearest to your users
5. Click "Create bucket"

### 4.2 Configure Public Access

1. Click on your `sww-videos` bucket
2. Go to "Settings" tab
3. Under "Public Access":
   - Click "Allow Access"
   - Copy the public URL (like `https://pub-xxx.r2.dev`)

### 4.3 Get R2 Credentials

1. In R2 Overview, click "Manage R2 API tokens"
2. Click "Create API token"
3. Settings:
   - Name: `sww-videos-access`
   - Permissions: Object Read & Write
   - Specify bucket: `sww-videos`
4. Click "Create API Token"
5. Save these credentials:
   - Access Key ID
   - Secret Access Key
   - Account ID (from your Cloudflare dashboard URL)

## Step 5: Upload Videos to R2

### Option A: Via Dashboard
1. Go to your `sww-videos` bucket
2. Click "Upload"
3. Select your 9:16 videos (MP4 recommended)

### Option B: Via Wrangler
```bash
# Upload a single video
wrangler r2 object put sww-videos/video1.mp4 --file=/path/to/video1.mp4

# Upload multiple videos
for video in /path/to/videos/*.mp4; do
  wrangler r2 object put sww-videos/$(basename "$video") --file="$video"
done
```

## Step 6: Generate Video Manifest

Create `.env` file in project root:

```env
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
R2_BUCKET_NAME=sww-videos
R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://pub-xxx.r2.dev
```

Generate manifest:

```bash
npm run manifest:generate
```

## Step 7: Configure Frontend

Create `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_COMMENTS_API=https://sww-comments.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev/api/comments
NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_BUCKET_URL=https://pub-xxx.r2.dev
```

## Step 8: Build and Deploy Frontend

```bash
# Build the Next.js app
npm run build

# Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
npx wrangler pages deploy out --project-name=say-what-want

# You'll get a URL like:
# https://say-what-want.pages.dev
```

## Step 9: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

### For the Frontend (Pages):
1. Go to Cloudflare Pages → your project → Custom domains
2. Add your domain
3. Follow DNS configuration instructions

### For the Worker (Comments API):
1. Update `workers/wrangler.toml`:
   ```toml
   route = "https://yourdomain.com/api/comments/*"
   ```
2. Redeploy worker: `wrangler deploy`

## Step 10: Test Everything

1. Visit your deployment URL
2. You should see:
   - Random video playing on the left
   - Comments interface on the right
3. Test features:
   - Post a comment
   - Unmute video
   - Refresh for new video
   - Search comments

## Monitoring

### View Worker Logs
```bash
cd workers
wrangler tail
```

### View KV Storage
```bash
# List all comments
wrangler kv:key list --binding COMMENTS_KV --prefix "comment:"

# View recent cache
wrangler kv:key get "recent:comments" --binding COMMENTS_KV
```

### Check R2 Usage
- Cloudflare Dashboard → R2 → Your bucket → Metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Comments not working
```bash
# Check worker status
curl https://your-worker.workers.dev/api/comments

# Check KV namespace
wrangler kv:key list --binding COMMENTS_KV
```

### Videos not loading
- Verify R2 bucket is public
- Check video manifest exists: `/public/cloudflare/video-manifest.json`
- Verify CORS settings on R2 bucket

### Rate limiting issues
```bash
# Clear rate limits
wrangler kv:key list --binding COMMENTS_KV --prefix "rate:" | \
  jq -r '.[].name' | \
  xargs -I {} wrangler kv:key delete {} --binding COMMENTS_KV
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Video Optimization**:
   - Keep videos under 50MB
   - Use H.264 codec for compatibility
   - Consider CDN caching

2. **Comments Optimization**:
   - The cache holds 5000 recent comments
   - Older comments are still accessible but load slower
   - Consider archiving very old comments

3. **Scaling**:
   - Free tier handles ~100K comments/day
   - Upgrade to Workers Paid for unlimited requests
   - R2 automatically scales

## Maintenance

### Backup Comments
```bash
# Export all comments
wrangler kv:key list --binding COMMENTS_KV --prefix "comment:" > comments-backup.json
```

### Update Video Manifest
```bash
# After adding new videos
npm run manifest:generate

# Rebuild and redeploy
npm run build
npx wrangler pages deploy out --project-name=say-what-want
```

### Clear All Comments (Reset)
```bash
# WARNING: This deletes all comments
wrangler kv:key list --binding COMMENTS_KV | \
  jq -r '.[].name' | \
  xargs -I {} wrangler kv:key delete {} --binding COMMENTS_KV
```

## Cost Estimates (Cloudflare Pricing)

**Free Tier Includes:**
- Workers: 100,000 requests/day
- KV: 100,000 reads/day, 1,000 writes/day
- R2: 10GB storage, 1M Class A operations, 10M Class B operations
- Pages: Unlimited sites and requests

**For 10,000 daily active users:**
- Workers: ~50,000 requests/day (well within free tier)
- KV: ~20,000 operations/day (within free tier)
- R2: Video bandwidth is the main cost (~$0.015/GB)
- Estimated: $0-10/month depending on video sizes

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Review worker logs: `wrangler tail`
3. Verify all environment variables are set
4. Ensure all services are deployed

# 🚀 Cloudflare Workers Deployment Guide

## Overview
This Next.js app deploys to Cloudflare Workers with:
- **Main Site**: Static Next.js build served via Workers Sites
- **Comments API**: Separate Worker with KV storage
- **Video Storage**: Cloudflare R2 bucket

## Quick Start (15 minutes total)

### Step 1: Initial Setup (5 min)
```bash
# Install dependencies if you haven't
npm install

# Login to Cloudflare
wrangler login
```

### Step 2: Create KV Namespace (2 min)
```bash
# Create KV namespace for comments
wrangler kv:namespace create "COMMENTS_KV"
```

Save the ID that's returned - you'll need it for both workers!

### Step 3: Create R2 Bucket (3 min)

1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) → **R2**
2. Click **Create bucket**
3. Name it: `sww-videos`
4. After creation, go to **Settings** → **Public Access** → **Allow Access**
5. Copy the public URL (like `https://pub-xxx.r2.dev`)

### Step 4: Configure Environment (2 min)

Run the automated setup:
```bash
npm run cloudflare:setup
```

Or manually update these files:

**wrangler.toml** (main site):
```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "COMMENTS_KV"
id = "YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE_ID"  # <- paste your KV ID here

[vars]
COMMENTS_WORKER_URL = "https://sww-comments.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev"
R2_BUCKET_URL = "https://pub-xxx.r2.dev"  # <- your R2 public URL
```

**workers/wrangler.toml** (comments API):
```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "COMMENTS_KV"
id = "YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE_ID"  # <- same KV ID here
```

### Step 5: Deploy Everything (3 min)

```bash
# Build the Next.js app
npm run build

# Deploy comments worker
cd workers
wrangler deploy

# Note the URL (like https://sww-comments.xxx.workers.dev)
cd ..

# Deploy main site
wrangler deploy
```

## Your URLs

After deployment:
- **Main Site**: `https://say-what-want.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev`
- **Comments API**: `https://sww-comments.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev`
- **R2 Videos**: `https://pub-xxx.r2.dev`

## Testing

```bash
# Test comments API
curl https://sww-comments.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev/api/comments

# Monitor logs
wrangler tail  # for main site
cd workers && wrangler tail  # for comments API

# Check KV storage
wrangler kv:key list --binding COMMENTS_KV
```

## Automated Deployment (GitHub Actions)

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        
      - name: Build Next.js
        run: npm run build
        
      - name: Deploy Comments Worker
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
          workingDirectory: workers
          command: deploy
          
      - name: Deploy Main Site
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
          command: deploy
```

Add to GitHub Secrets:
- `CF_API_TOKEN`: Your Cloudflare API token

## Troubleshooting

### Comments not working?
- Check both workers have the same KV namespace ID
- Verify COMMENTS_WORKER_URL in wrangler.toml
- Check CORS headers in comments-worker.js

### Videos not loading?
- Ensure R2 bucket has public access enabled
- Check R2_BUCKET_URL in environment variables
- Verify video-manifest.json exists in public/cloudflare/

### Build errors?
- Make sure you're using Node.js 18+
- Run `npm run build` locally first
- Check for TypeScript errors

## That's it! 🎉

Your app is now deployed globally on Cloudflare's edge network!

# Cloudflare R2 Video Storage Setup

## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Create R2 Bucket in Cloudflare Dashboard
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Navigate to R2 → Create bucket
3. Name: `sww-videos`
4. Location: Automatic
5. Click "Create bucket"

### 2. Configure Public Access
1. In your R2 bucket settings → Settings tab
2. Under "Public Access", click "Allow Access"
3. Copy the public URL (looks like: `https://pub-xxxxx.r2.dev`)

### 3. Create R2 API Token
1. Go to R2 → Manage R2 API tokens
2. Click "Create API token"
3. Name: `sww-videos-upload`
4. Permissions: **Object Read & Write**
5. Specify bucket: `sww-videos`
6. Click "Create API Token"
7. **Save these values:**
   - Access Key ID
   - Secret Access Key

### 4. Install Wrangler R2 CLI
```bash
npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler
```

### 5. Configure Environment Variables
Create `.env.local` file:
```env
# R2 Configuration
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=85eadfbdf07c02e77aa5dc3b46beb0f9
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_here
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_here
R2_BUCKET_NAME=sww-videos
R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://pub-xxxxx.r2.dev
NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_BUCKET_URL=https://pub-xxxxx.r2.dev
```

### 6. Upload Videos Script
Save this as `upload-videos-to-r2.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Configuration
SOURCE_DIR="/Users/terminal_1/_SWW/sww-videos"
BUCKET_NAME="sww-videos"

# Upload all videos
for video in "$SOURCE_DIR"/*.mp4; do
  filename=$(basename "$video")
  echo "Uploading $filename..."
  wrangler r2 object put "$BUCKET_NAME/$filename" --file="$video"
done

echo "✅ Upload complete!"
```

### 7. Alternative: Use rclone for Bulk Upload
```bash
# Install rclone
brew install rclone

# Configure rclone for R2
rclone config
# Choose: n (new remote)
# Name: r2
# Storage: s3
# Provider: Cloudflare
# Access Key ID: [your key]
# Secret Access Key: [your secret]
# Endpoint: https://[account-id].r2.cloudflarestorage.com
# Location constraint: auto

# Upload all videos
rclone copy /Users/terminal_1/_SWW/sww-videos/ r2:sww-videos/ --progress
```

### 8. Update App Configuration
In `config/video-source.ts`, change:
```typescript
useLocal: false,  // Switch from local to R2
```

### 9. Generate R2 Manifest
```bash
node scripts/r2-manifest-generator.js
```

### 10. Deploy Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: configure R2 video storage"
git push origin main
# Auto-deploys to Cloudflare Pages
```

## Your Videos
- **Total Videos**: 238 files
- **Total Size**: 1.3GB
- **Source**: `/Users/terminal_1/_SWW/sww-videos/`

## Next Steps
1. Create the R2 bucket in Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Get the public URL and API credentials
3. Tell me when you have them
4. I'll help you upload all 238 videos
