# üîÑ SCROLL SYSTEM - Final Specification

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: SPECIFICATION COMPLETE - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Scroll behavior must be predictable and reliable

---

## üìã USER REQUIREMENTS (Confirmed with User #1)

### What User Actually Asked

**User's question:** "Does React have a native way to remember scroll position when switching between views (mt=human vs mt=AI)?"

**Simple answer:** No, React doesn't automatically save/restore scroll position when component content changes. You need to manually save `element.scrollTop` before content changes and restore it after.

### What User Actually Wants

**A simple, predictable scroll system with independent position memory for each view.**

---

## üéØ THE SPECIFICATION

### Core Concept: Independent View Memory

**4 Independent Views (each has its own saved scroll position):**
1. `mt=human` view
2. `mt=AI` view  
3. `mt=ALL` view
4. **Filter active** view (any filter combination = single view)

### The 5 Rules (Simple & Complete)

#### Rule 1: Default is Always Bottom
- No saved position for current view? ‚Üí **Bottom (newest messages)**
- Fresh page load or refresh? ‚Üí **Bottom**
- Initial load with URL filters already active? ‚Üí **Bottom**

#### Rule 2: Reaching Bottom Clears THAT View's Position
- User **manually scrolls** to bottom ‚Üí Clear current view's position (if exists)
- **Auto-scroll** happens (new message arrives) ‚Üí Clear current view's position (if exists)
- **Optimization:** If position already null ‚Üí Don't trigger clear (avoid unnecessary operations)
- **Other views remain untouched** (independent memory)

#### Rule 3: Filter Behavior
- **Filter toggle ON, no filter bar change** ‚Üí Use saved filter position (if exists), else bottom
- **Filter toggle ON, filter bar changes** ‚Üí Clear filter position ‚Üí Bottom
- **Filter toggle OFF** ‚Üí Return to base view (mt=human/AI/ALL) with its saved position (if exists)

#### Rule 4: Search = Filter Bar Change
- Search activation ‚Üí Counts as filter bar modification
- Clears filter view position ‚Üí Bottom

#### Rule 5: New Messages (Polling)
- **User at bottom** ‚Üí Auto-scroll to show new message ‚Üí Clears that view's position (if exists)
- **User scrolled up** (saved position exists) ‚Üí Stay put, don't interrupt

---

## üß† The Logic (How It Works)

### View Independence
Each view maintains its own position completely independently:
- Switch from `mt=AI` (scrolled up, position saved) ‚Üí `mt=human` (no position) ‚Üí Goes to bottom
- Auto-scroll in `mt=human` clears `mt=human` position, **but `mt=AI` still remembers** where user was
- Switch back to `mt=AI` ‚Üí Returns to saved scroll position
- Clean, predictable, no cross-view interference

### Position Lifecycle
```
View loads ‚Üí Check for saved position
  ‚îú‚îÄ Has saved position? ‚Üí Restore to that position
  ‚îî‚îÄ No saved position? ‚Üí Go to bottom

User scrolls ‚Üí Monitor position
  ‚îú‚îÄ Scrolled up? ‚Üí Save position for this view
  ‚îî‚îÄ At bottom? ‚Üí Clear position for this view (if exists)

View switches ‚Üí Independent memory
  ‚îî‚îÄ Each view remembers its own position (or defaults to bottom)
```

## üìù Current State of Scroll System

**Status:** Broken and unreliable  
**Symptoms:**
- Initial page load sometimes scrolls to top instead of bottom
- Channel toggles (human ‚ü∑ AI) randomly end up at 6% from top
- Behavior is non-deterministic (works sometimes, breaks other times)

**Root cause:** 9 different state variables tracking scroll across 4 different files. Multiple useEffect hooks firing in unpredictable order causing race conditions.

### Files Currently Involved in Scroll (The Mess)

1. `components/CommentsStream.tsx` - Initial scroll effect (lines 829-862)
2. `hooks/useScrollRestoration.ts` - Channel/filter toggle restoration (174 lines, 3 separate effects)
3. `utils/scrollBehaviors.ts` - Utility functions (good utilities, keep these)
4. `hooks/useMobileKeyboard.ts` - Mobile keyboard handling (works fine)
5. `hooks/useMessageTypeFilters.ts` - Duplicate scroll saving

**Problem:** 9 different state variables across these files trying to coordinate scroll behavior.

## üíæ Implementation Data Structure

### Storage Model

**Simple key-value storage (localStorage or React state):**
```typescript
interface ScrollPositions {
  'mt=human': number | null;
  'mt=AI': number | null;
  'mt=ALL': number | null;
  'filter-active': number | null;
}

// Example state:
{
  'mt=human': null,        // At bottom (or never scrolled up)
  'mt=AI': 1500,           // Scrolled up, position saved
  'mt=ALL': null,          // At bottom
  'filter-active': 2300    // Scrolled up in filter view
}
```

### View Key Logic
```typescript
function getCurrentViewKey(activeChannel: string, isFilterActive: boolean): string {
  if (isFilterActive) {
    return 'filter-active';
  }
  return `mt=${activeChannel}`; // 'mt=human', 'mt=AI', 'mt=ALL'
}
```

## üîß Implementation Approach Options

### Option A: Centralized Hook (Recommended)
Create single `useScrollPositionManager` hook that:
- Stores 4 view positions
- Monitors scroll events
- Handles view switches
- Clears positions when at bottom

**Pros:** Clean, testable, single source of truth  
**Cons:** Need to refactor existing code

### Option B: Fix Current Architecture
Keep existing hooks but:
- Simplify to 4-position model
- Fix race conditions
- Remove duplicate logic

**Pros:** Less refactoring  
**Cons:** Still distributed, harder to maintain

### Option C: Hybrid
Keep utilities, create lightweight position manager, hook into existing flow

**Pros:** Minimal changes  
**Cons:** Still some distributed logic

---

## üé¨ Next Steps

### Step 1: Choose Implementation Approach
**Decision needed:** Which option (A, B, or C)?

**Recommendation:** Start with Option C (Hybrid)
- Create simple position manager
- Hook into existing scroll events
- Minimal disruption
- Can evolve to Option A later if needed

### Step 2: Understand Current Code
Before implementing, need to:
1. Read `components/CommentsStream.tsx` scroll logic
2. Read `hooks/useScrollRestoration.ts` 
3. Understand how `activeChannel` and `isFilterEnabled` work
4. Find where scroll events are currently monitored

### Step 3: Implementation Plan
Will be created after understanding current code

### Step 4: Testing Checklist
- [ ] Fresh page load ‚Üí Bottom
- [ ] Page refresh ‚Üí Bottom  
- [ ] Switch mt=human ‚Üí mt=AI ‚Üí Both at bottom first time
- [ ] Scroll up in mt=AI, switch to mt=human, switch back ‚Üí Returns to position
- [ ] At bottom in any view, new message ‚Üí Auto-scroll
- [ ] Scrolled up, new message ‚Üí Don't interrupt
- [ ] Filter toggle with no changes ‚Üí Remember position
- [ ] Filter bar changes ‚Üí Go to bottom
- [ ] Search activated ‚Üí Go to bottom

- Test thoroughly

### Ready to Begin Implementation

Next: Choose approach and start reading current code to understand integration points.
