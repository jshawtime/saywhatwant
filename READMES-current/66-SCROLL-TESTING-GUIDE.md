# üß™ Scroll System Testing Guide

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - READY FOR TESTING

---

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

### What Was Done

**Created:**
- ‚úÖ `hooks/useScrollPositionMemory.ts` (171 lines) - Clean, simple scroll management

**Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `components/CommentsStream.tsx` 
  - Added new hook integration
  - Replaced complex scroll effect with simple 7-line version
  
- ‚úÖ `hooks/useMessageTypeFilters.ts`
  - Removed scroll position saving (lines 41-61 cleaned up)
  - Made streamRef optional

**Deleted:**
- ‚úÖ `hooks/useScrollRestoration.ts` (174 lines) - Completely removed

**Result:**
- Net reduction: ~200 lines of complex code
- All scroll logic in ONE file
- No race conditions
- 4 independent position slots

## üéØ Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Fresh Page Load
**Action:** Load the app for the first time  
**Expected:** Scroll to bottom (newest messages visible)  
**Check:** Console shows `[Init] Initial scroll to bottom`

### Test 2: Page Refresh
**Action:** Refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R)  
**Expected:** Scroll to bottom regardless of previous state  
**Check:** Always starts at bottom

### Test 3: Channel Toggle (First Time - Both at Bottom)
**Action:** 
1. Load page ‚Üí mt=human (at bottom)
2. Click AI button ‚Üí mt=AI
3. Click Human button ‚Üí mt=human

**Expected:** Both views show at bottom on first visit  
**Check:** Console shows `[ScrollMemory] No saved position for mt=AI, going to bottom`

### Test 4: Channel Toggle (With Saved Position)
**Action:**
1. Load page ‚Üí mt=human (at bottom)
2. Scroll up 50 messages in mt=human
3. Click AI button ‚Üí mt=AI (goes to bottom)
4. Scroll up 30 messages in mt=AI
5. Click Human button ‚Üí mt=human (returns to 50 messages up)
6. Click AI button ‚Üí mt=AI (returns to 30 messages up)

**Expected:** Each view remembers its scroll position  
**Check:** Console shows `[ScrollMemory] Restoring mt=human to position XXXX`

### Test 5: At Bottom, New Message Arrives
**Action:**
1. Be at bottom in any view
2. Wait for new message (or submit one yourself)

**Expected:** Auto-scroll to show new message, position cleared  
**Check:** Console shows `[ScrollMemory] At bottom - clearing mt=human position`

### Test 6: Scrolled Up, New Message Arrives  
**Action:**
1. Scroll up in any view
2. Wait for new message (or submit one yourself)

**Expected:** Stay at current position, don't interrupt  
**Check:** Position remains saved, no auto-scroll

### Test 7: Filter Toggle (No Filter Bar Changes)
**Action:**
1. Add username filter (click a username)
2. Toggle filter ON
3. Scroll up in filter view
4. Toggle filter OFF ‚Üí back to channel view
5. Toggle filter ON again

**Expected:** Filter view remembers scroll position  
**Check:** Console shows `[ScrollMemory] Restoring filter-active to position XXXX`

### Test 8: Filter Bar Changes
**Action:**
1. Toggle filter ON
2. Scroll up
3. Add another username filter (click different username)

**Expected:** Scroll to bottom when filter bar changes  
**Check:** Console shows `[ScrollMemory] Filter bar changed - clearing filter position`

### Test 9: Search (Counts as Filter Change)
**Action:**
1. Be in any view at any position
2. Type in search box

**Expected:** Search counts as filter, goes to bottom  
**Check:** Console shows filter change behavior

---

## üîç What to Watch in Console

Good scroll behavior shows these patterns:

### When Scrolling Up
```
[ScrollMemory] Saving mt=human position: 1234
```

### When Reaching Bottom
```
[ScrollMemory] At bottom - clearing mt=human position
```

### When Switching Views
```
[ScrollMemory] View changed: mt=human ‚Üí mt=AI
[ScrollMemory] Restoring mt=AI to position 5678
```
OR
```
[ScrollMemory] View changed: mt=human ‚Üí mt=AI
[ScrollMemory] No saved position for mt=AI, going to bottom
```

### When Filter Bar Changes
```
[ScrollMemory] Filter bar changed - clearing filter position
[ScrollMemory] Previous hash: user1:123456789|word1|
[ScrollMemory] Current hash: user1:123456789,user2:987654321|word1|
[ScrollMemory] Scrolling to bottom after filter change
```

## üö® What Would Indicate Problems

### Bad Signs:
- ‚ùå Ending up at random positions (6% from top, etc.)
- ‚ùå Position not restoring when switching back to a view
- ‚ùå Race condition logs (multiple scroll operations in one cycle)
- ‚ùå Filter position NOT clearing when adding/removing filters

### Good Signs:
- ‚úÖ Consistent behavior (same action = same result)
- ‚úÖ Clean console logs showing decision path
- ‚úÖ Positions restore exactly
- ‚úÖ Bottom-clearing works when reaching bottom

---

## üìä localStorage Check

Open DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage ‚Üí Check for:

```javascript
// Key: sww-scroll-positions
{
  "mt=human": null,        // At bottom (or never scrolled up)
  "mt=AI": 1234,           // Scrolled up, position saved
  "mt=ALL": null,          // At bottom
  "filter-active": 5678    // Scrolled up in filter view
}
```

**Validation:**
- Values should be numbers or null
- Should update as you scroll
- Should clear when reaching bottom
- Filter position should clear when filter bar changes

---

## üéÆ Stress Test

**Rapid Switching:**
1. Switch mt=human ‚Üí mt=AI ‚Üí mt=ALL rapidly (10+ times)
2. All views should behave consistently
3. No errors in console
4. Positions should restore correctly

**Filter Stress:**
1. Toggle filter on/off rapidly
2. Add/remove filters while scrolled
3. Should always be deterministic

**Scroll Stress:**
1. Scroll up, down, up, down rapidly
2. Switch views while scrolling
3. Positions should save/restore correctly

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

All of these must be true:

1. ‚úÖ Fresh load always goes to bottom
2. ‚úÖ Each view (4 total) maintains independent position
3. ‚úÖ Positions restore when switching views
4. ‚úÖ Positions clear when user reaches bottom
5. ‚úÖ Filter position clears when filter bar changes
6. ‚úÖ No race conditions or random positions
7. ‚úÖ Console logs are clean and informative
8. ‚úÖ Can switch views 100 times without issues
9. ‚úÖ localStorage updates correctly

---

## üêõ If Something Breaks

**Check these:**
1. Console logs - what decision path was taken?
2. localStorage - are positions being saved correctly?
3. `isNearBottom` - is detection working?
4. `filteredCommentsLength` - is content actually changing?
5. `filterState` hash - is filter change detection working?

**Common fixes:**
- Clear localStorage: `localStorage.removeItem('sww-scroll-positions')`
- Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
- Check if `useAutoScrollDetection` is working (provides `isNearBottom`)
