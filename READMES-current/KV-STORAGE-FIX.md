# KV Storage Fix - Connection Issue Resolved

## The Problem
- Messages only showed in your main Chrome profile
- Other profiles showed "No comments yet"
- KV wasn't connecting to the frontend

## Root Cause
Frontend was pointing to **non-existent** URL:
- ❌ `https://sww-comments.workers.dev` (doesn't exist)
- ✅ `https://sww-comments.bootloaders.workers.dev` (actual worker)

## What I Discovered

### KV IS Working!
```bash
# Worker has 37+ messages stored:
curl https://sww-comments.bootloaders.workers.dev/api/comments

# Including old messages from JSHAW, Joepher, etc.
# Test message saved successfully
```

### The Fix
1. Updated `config/comments-source.ts` to use correct URL
2. Fixed `wrangler.toml` with correct account/namespace IDs
3. Pushed to main to trigger deployment

## Current Status
- ✅ Worker API: Working perfectly
- ✅ KV Storage: Has 37+ messages
- ✅ POST/GET: Both functional
- ⏳ Frontend: Deploying now (2-5 min)

## What You'll See After Deploy

### All Browser Profiles Will Show:
- Old messages from January (JSHAW, Joepher, etc.)
- Any new messages posted to KV
- Same data everywhere (true cloud storage)

### Your Main Profile
The messages you see there are from **localStorage** before we switched to cloud. They're NOT in KV yet.

## Testing After Deploy
1. Wait 5 minutes for Cloudflare to deploy
2. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) all browser profiles
3. All should show the same KV messages
4. Post a new message - it should appear everywhere

## Technical Details
- **Worker URL**: `https://sww-comments.bootloaders.workers.dev`
- **KV Namespace**: `ddf6162d4c874d52bb6e41d1c3889a0f`
- **Account ID**: `85eadfbdf07c02e77aa5dc3b46beb0f9`
- **Messages in KV**: 37+ (and growing)

*The messages "today is a good day" and "who said that?" are only in your localStorage, not KV yet*
