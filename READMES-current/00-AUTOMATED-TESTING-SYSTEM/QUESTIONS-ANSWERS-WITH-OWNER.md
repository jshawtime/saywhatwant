# Questions & Answers with Owner

## ðŸ“‹ How This Document Works

**Purpose:** Maintain a permanent record of all Q&A, decisions, and context discussions about the testing system and app behavior.

**Format:**
- **Newest entries at the top** (reverse chronological)
- **Timestamp headings** for each conversation session (simple format: `## 2025-10-10 4:45 PM`)
- **Owner responses** go directly under the questions
- **AI reads this file** at the start of testing sessions to understand recent decisions

**Usage:**
1. AI asks questions or presents issues â†’ adds entry with timestamp
2. Owner responds in the same section
3. New conversations push old ones down
4. All context preserved for future reference

**Why this helps:**
- Preserves decision-making context across sessions
- AI can reference past answers without re-asking
- Documents the "why" behind testing choices
- Helps onboard future AI agents or team members

### 5 Failing Tests - Feedback Requested

**Context:** Automated testing system is now complete with 15 tests. 10 passing, 5 failing. All failures appear to be test implementation issues, not app bugs.

**The 5 Issues:**

**1. Color System - "user is assigned a random color on first visit"**
- Issue: `localStorage['sww-color']` returns `null`
- Why: Test checks immediately, before React hydration completes
- Type: Test bug (timing)

**2. Comments Stream - "user color is stored and persists"**
- Issue: Same as #1 - localStorage null
- Why: Same timing issue
- Type: Test bug (timing)

**3. Smoke Test - "no console errors on initial load"**
- Issue: React hydration warning about color style mismatch
- Error: `Server: color:rgb(216,80,178)` vs `Client: color:rgb(150,172,80)`
- Why: Random colors generated on both server and client
- Type: Test too strict (hydration warning is expected/normal)

**4. Comments Stream - "scroll position is maintained"**
- Issue: `scrollTop` is 0 after trying to scroll
- Why: Wrong selector or no scrollable content loaded yet
- Type: Test bug (selector or timing)

**5. Video Player - "video player can be toggled on and off"**
- Issue: Video stays visible (opacity: 1) after clearing localStorage
- Why: Not reloading page after `localStorage.clear()`
- Type: Test bug (missing page reload)

**Pattern Summary:**
- 3 tests: Timing issues (not waiting for React/hydration)
- 1 test: Too strict (filtering needed for expected warnings)
- 1 test: Wrong selector or missing reload

**Question for Owner:** 
What's your feedback on these issues? Should we:
- Fix all 5 now using the established workflow?
- Fix them one at a time as examples?
- Focus on something else first?
- Any specific concerns about the analysis?

**Owner Response:**
