# Audio Notification System for Filters

## Overview
A sophisticated notification system that plays sounds when new messages match your filters, with visual feedback via bold filter items.

## Features

### ðŸ”Š Sound Options
Each filter can have its own notification sound:
- **Silent** (Ban icon) - Default, no sound
- **Delightful** (Sparkles icon) - Pleasant chime
- **Gamer** (Gamepad icon) - Gaming-style alert
- **Hello** (Hand icon) - Friendly greeting sound
- **Horn** (Volume icon) - Attention-grabbing horn
- **Subtle** (Music icon) - Soft notification

### ðŸ“Œ How It Works

#### Setting Up Notifications
1. Add filters to the filter bar (usernames or words)
2. Enable the filter bar (must be active for notifications)
3. Right-click on any filter item
4. Select a sound from the context menu
5. The selected sound icon appears next to the filter

#### When Messages Arrive
1. New messages are checked against active filters
2. If a match is found and sound is enabled:
   - The notification sound plays
   - The filter becomes **bold** in the filter bar
3. Multiple matches play sounds in order with 1-second cooldown
4. Hovering over a bold filter marks it as "read" (unbold)

### ðŸŽ¯ Important Notes
- **Filter bar must be active** for notifications to work
- **Negative filters** (-word) do NOT have notifications
- Only positive filters can trigger sounds
- Respects device volume and mute settings

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
Following the "Think, Then Code" philosophy:

```
notification-system.ts     â†’ Core sound management
FilterNotificationMenu.tsx â†’ Context menu UI
FilterBar.tsx             â†’ Visual feedback (bold/unbold)
CommentsStream.tsx        â†’ Match detection logic
```

### Sound Management
```typescript
class NotificationSystem {
  // Singleton pattern for global sound control
  // Preloads all audio files for instant playback
  // Manages cooldown between sounds
  // Handles sound queue for multiple matches
}
```

### Cooldown System
- **1 second minimum** between any sounds
- Prevents audio spam from rapid messages
- Queues sounds if multiple arrive quickly
- Plays them in order with proper spacing

### Storage
All preferences saved to localStorage:
```javascript
localStorage['sww-filter-notifications'] = {
  "username:rgb(255,0,0)": {
    sound: "delightful",
    isUnread: false
  },
  "keyword:rgb(0,255,0)": {
    sound: "horn",
    isUnread: true  // Bold in UI
  }
}
```

## User Experience

### Visual Feedback
- **Sound Icon**: Shows next to filter when enabled
- **Bold Filter**: Indicates unread notification
- **Box Shadow**: Colored outline when unread
- **Hover Effect**: Returns to normal on mouseover

### Interaction Flow
```
1. User adds filter â†’ Default silent (no icon)
2. Right-click filter â†’ Context menu appears
3. Select sound â†’ Icon appears, sound enabled
4. New match arrives â†’ Sound plays, filter bolds
5. User hovers filter â†’ Returns to normal
```

### Multiple Matches
When a message matches multiple filters:
1. Collect all matching filter sounds
2. Remove duplicates and 'none' sounds
3. Play in alphabetical order
4. 1-second gap between each sound

## Console Logging
```
[Notification] Played sound: delightful
[Notification] Updated DeepThought:rgb(128,0,255) to use sound: horn
[Notification] Failed to play sound gamer: DOMException
[Filter] Marked as unread: keyword:rgb(255,255,255)
```

## Browser Compatibility
- Uses standard HTML5 Audio API
- Fallback for browsers without audio support
- Handles autoplay restrictions gracefully
- Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Performance Considerations
- Audio files preloaded on initialization
- Only checks messages when filters active
- Event delegation for efficient re-renders
- Minimal localStorage reads/writes

## Future Enhancements
Potential additions:
- Volume control per sound
- Custom sound uploads
- Sound preview on hover
- Notification history log
- Sound categories/themes
- Keyboard shortcuts for sound selection
- Visual notification badges with count
- Different sounds for different filter types

## Philosophy Notes
This feature exemplifies the core principles:
- **Simple**: Right-click to set sound
- **Strong**: Handles edge cases gracefully  
- **Solid**: Scales to many filters/messages
- **User First**: Non-intrusive, fully optional
- **Logic Over Rules**: Smart cooldown management

## Files Modified
- `modules/notificationSystem.ts` - Core module
- `components/FilterNotificationMenu.tsx` - Menu UI
- `components/FilterBar.tsx` - Filter UI updates
- `components/CommentsStream.tsx` - Match detection
- `public/sww-sfx/` - Sound files directory
