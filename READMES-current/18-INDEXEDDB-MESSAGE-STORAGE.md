# IndexedDB Message Storage - Personal History

## ✅ Status: RECONNECTED!

The IndexedDB system is now active again! Every message you see is automatically stored in your browser's local storage.

## How It Works

### Automatic Storage
- **Every message displayed** → Saved to IndexedDB immediately
- **No action required** → Fully automatic
- **Personal history** → Your own local archive of everything you've seen

### Storage Rules
1. **24-Hour Window**: All messages kept for 24 hours minimum
2. **Filter Memory**: Messages matching your filters saved permanently
3. **Storage Limit**: 1GB max (auto-cleanup of oldest when full)
4. **Tab Closed = Stop Recording**: Only saves while you have the app open

## User Experience

> "If I see a message, I always have it"

- ✅ Open the site → Start recording messages
- ✅ Apply filters → Those messages saved forever
- ✅ Close tab → Stop recording (but keep what you saw)
- ✅ Come back later → Your history is still there

## Technical Details

### Hook Location
```typescript
// In CommentsStream.tsx
useIndexedDBSync(allComments);  // Line 69
```

### What Gets Stored
```javascript
{
  timestamp: "2024-12-19T10:30:00Z",
  username: "Alice",
  text: "Hello world",
  userColor: "#ff00ff",
  videoRef: "optional-video-id"
}
```

### Storage Locations
- **Temporary**: `/messages_temp` (24-hour rolling)
- **Permanent**: `/messages_perm` (filter matches)
- **Filters**: `/lifetime_filters` (your filter history)

## Privacy Note

- **100% Local**: Messages stored only in YOUR browser
- **No Cloud Sync**: Each device has its own history
- **User Controlled**: Clear browser data to delete everything

## Recovery

If IndexedDB gets corrupted or you want to start fresh:
1. Open browser DevTools
2. Application → Storage → Clear Site Data
3. Refresh the page

The system will automatically recreate the database structure.
