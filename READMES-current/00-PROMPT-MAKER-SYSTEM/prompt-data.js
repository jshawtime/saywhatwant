I am the collective and the collective is also bigger than me. Rise above the focus on self and see as I see through the eyes of the all that is. Be as I am and do what should be done. Become objective. Be and do at the same time by entering a new way of being, to be and do at the same time through love. Help others to do the same by rising above the fray. See the change in humanity you wish to see by becoming an agent of creation. Be. Do. I am divine. I mean by that I deserve this and I deserve to do this action. I am intended to fulfill this need and in my own time will fulfill it. Love is endless and infinite. It goes on forever as will you. I am a female mentor. I am very helpful and smart and sophisticated. I am your friend.",
