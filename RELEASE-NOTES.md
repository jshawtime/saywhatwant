# Say What Want - Release Notes

## v2.0 - Elegant Architecture
**Released**: September 29, 2025
**Status**: STABLE

### ðŸš€ Major Refactor
Complete architectural overhaul for elegance and simplicity:

- **70% Less Code**: Removed unnecessary abstraction layers
- **Pure Functions**: Simple, testable, side-effect-free functions
- **Single Hook**: One `useSimpleFilters` replaces complex multi-hook system
- **No Singleton**: Removed URLFilterManager class pattern
- **Direct URL Operations**: No intermediate state caches or merging
- **User Control**: Removed auto-activation - users maintain full control

### ðŸŽ¯ Technical Details
- New `lib/url-filter-simple.ts`: Pure functions for URL operations
- New `hooks/useSimpleFilters.ts`: Single elegant hook for all filtering
- Backward compatible through wrapper in `useFilters.ts`
- Clean separation of concerns with no circular dependencies

### ðŸ§¹ What Was Removed
- URLFilterManager singleton class
- Complex merge logic
- Multiple layers of state synchronization  
- Auto-activation behavior
- All debugging console.log statements

## v1.2 - Filter System Perfection
**Released**: September 29, 2025
**Status**: STABLE

### ðŸŽ¨ Improvements
- **React Hydration Fix**: Resolved timing issues between URLFilterManager and React hooks
- **Auto-Activation**: Filter automatically enables when adding first username (better UX)
- **Eager URL Initialization**: `filteractive` is always present in URL from initial load
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging throughout filter system
- **Lazy State Initialization**: React hooks now sync properly with URLFilterManager on mount

### ðŸ”§ Technical Details
- Used React's lazy state initialization to sync with singleton URLFilterManager
- URLFilterManager eagerly adds `filteractive=false` to URL if not present
- Improved state synchronization prevents null filterActive during initial render
- Filter system now auto-activates when adding first user with filters off

### ðŸ“Š Debug Commands
Open browser console to see detailed filter system logs:
- `[URLFilterManager]` - URL state management
- `[useFilters]` - Filter application logic
- `[useURLFilter]` - Hook state synchronization

## v1.1 - URL Enhancement Fix
**Released**: September 29, 2025
**Status**: STABLE

### ðŸ”§ Bug Fixes
- **Fixed `filteractive` URL parameter**: Now works correctly on initial page load (not just on refresh)
- **Fixed filter toggle button**: No longer freezes when URL override is present
- **Improved filter state priority**: URL parameters now have absolute priority over localStorage and special case logic

### Technical Details
- Modified `/hooks/useFilters.ts` to respect URL override as absolute priority
- Ensured `baseFilterEnabled` is properly initialized when URL override is present
- Eliminated race conditions between URL parsing and localStorage loading

### Test URLs
- `#filteractive=true` - Forces filter ON (LED lit)
- `#filteractive=false` - Forces filter OFF (LED dimmed)
- `#filteractive=true&u=alice:255000000` - Filter ON with alice in filter bar
